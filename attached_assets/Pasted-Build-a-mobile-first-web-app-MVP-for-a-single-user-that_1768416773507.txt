Build a mobile first web app MVP for a single user that:
•	Lets the user snap photos of dishes and restaurant receipts.
•	Uses a low cost LLM to extract itemized dish data from receipts.
•	Links dish photos to specific receipt line items.
•	Captures dish level ratings.
•	Provides light data visualization and a great flow for me as the only user.
No social/feed components are needed for this version.
Stack & architecture
•	Frontend:
•	Mobile first, responsive web app.
•	Use React (or another modern JS framework if you prefer).
•	Optimize for “open → camera immediately”.
•	Backend:
•	Node + Express or Python + FastAPI; choose one and keep it minimal.
•	Assume a single user for now (no auth system needed).
•	Data:
•	Will provision a database later
LLM for receipt extraction
•	Use a low cost LLM (e.g., OpenAI GPT 4o mini or equivalent) to parse receipt images into structured JSON.
•	The extracted structure should include:
•	Restaurant name
•	Restaurant address (if available)
•	Date and time
•	Receipt total
•	Line items:
•	Dish name (string)
•	Dish price (numeric; best effort, null if unclear)
•	Implement a backend endpoint, e.g. POST /api/parse-receipt, that:
1.	Accepts an uploaded image (receipt).
2.	Sends it to the LLM with a prompt that requests strict JSON output.
3.	Validates and returns the structured receipt data.
•	Provide basic error handling and a simple manual correction UI so I can fix dish names/prices when parsing is wrong.
Data model (single user)
Implement at least:
•	Restaurant:
•	id
•	name
•	address (optional)
•	Receipt:
•	id
•	restaurant_id
•	datetime
•	total_amount
•	raw_llm_output (JSON for debugging)
•	Dish:
•	id
•	restaurant_id
•	name
•	DishInstance (dish on a specific visit):
•	id
•	dish_id
•	receipt_id
•	price
•	rating (enum/string: "Elite" | "Would order again" | "Should try once" | "Not for me")
•	DishPhoto:
•	id
•	dish_instance_id (nullable until linked)
•	image_url / storage path
•	created_at
There is no User table required for now; assume everything belongs to a single developer user.
Mobile capture flow (core UX)
The UX should feel good enough that I could realistically use it at every restaurant visit.
1.	Launch → camera
•	On mobile, when I open the app:
•	Show a “Capture” screen with the camera active by default.
•	Provide two prominent buttons/toggles:
•	“Dish Photo”
•	“Receipt Photo”
•	Default mode: Dish Photo.
2.	Dish photo capture
•	In “Dish Photo” mode:
•	Allow me to take a photo of a dish.
•	After capture:
•	Save the photo (local or cloud storage; any simple approach is fine).
•	Create a DishPhoto record with a null dish_instance_id.
•	Let me:
•	Either “Attach to an existing visit” (choose from a list of recent receipts), or
•	“Save to link later” (if I haven’t captured the receipt yet).
•	For the MVP, assume one dish per photo.
3.	Receipt capture & parsing
•	In “Receipt Photo” mode:
•	Allow me to take a photo of the restaurant receipt.
•	Call POST /api/parse-receipt to get structured data from the LLM.
•	Show a review screen:
•	Restaurant name
•	Date/time
•	Total, tax, tip
•	Line items with dish names and prices in editable fields.
•	Let me:
•	Correct dish names and prices.
•	Confirm and save.
•	After save, create:
•	Restaurant (if new) and Receipt.
•	Dish records (creating or reusing by restaurant + dish name).
•	DishInstance records for each line item with the parsed/edited price.
4.	Linking photos ↔ line items
•	Immediately after saving a new receipt, prompt:
•	“Link your dish photos to this visit.”
•	Show:
•	The DishInstance list for this receipt (dish name + price).
•	All recent unlinked DishPhoto entries (e.g., last 24h) with thumbnails.
•	Interaction pattern:
•	Tap a dish instance → choose one photo to attach.
•	Or tap a photo → choose a dish instance.
•	Once linked, update DishPhoto.dish_instance_id.
5.	Rating each dish
•	After a photo is linked to a DishInstance, show a rating bar:
•	4 buttons: "Elite", "Would order again", "Should try once", "Not for me".
•	Store the rating in DishInstance.rating.
•	Make this rating step prominent but low friction (e.g., immediately visible under the photo with one tap).
Views focused on my experience
1. Capture screen (default)
•	Camera view with:
•	Mode toggle (Dish / Receipt).
•	Simple, thumb friendly controls.
•	Make this the default route since I’ll use it most.
2. My Dishes
•	Display an Instagram style grid of my dish photos:
•	Each tile shows the dish photo.
•	A small badge or color to indicate rating (Elite / Would order again / Should try once / Not for me).
•	Include a toggle to sort:
•	By most recent.
•	By rating (order: Elite → Would order again → Should try once → Not for me → unrated).
•	On tapping a tile, show a detail view with:
•	Dish name.
•	Restaurant name.
•	Visit date/time.
•	Price.
•	Rating (editable).
3. Receipts / Visits
•	A simple list of receipts:
•	Restaurant name.
•	Date/time.
•	Total amount.
•	Tapping a receipt shows:
•	Line items (dish instances) with name, price, rating, and any linked photos (thumbnails).
•	Ability to link any remaining unlinked photos to a dish instance from here.
4. Stats / Data visualization (for me)
•	A lightweight stats page to help validate data quality and usefulness:
•	Number of dishes recorded.
•	Count of dishes by rating category (bar chart or list).
•	Total spend captured across all receipts.
•	Number of distinct restaurants visited.
•	Simple time breakdown (e.g., dishes per month).
•	Use a basic chart library or simple styled lists; prioritize clarity over design.
Developer friendly aspects
•	Keep the codebase small and understandable; this is for me to iterate on:
•	Separate modules for:
•	Receipt parsing (LLM client + prompt).
•	Persistence (DB models).
•	Linking logic (photos ↔ dish instances).
•	Add short, clear comments where logic is non obvious.
•	Make it easy to:
•	Swap the LLM provider or model.
•	Replace the image storage implementation.
•	Later add user accounts and social features, but don’t add them now.
Non goals for this MVP
•	No social feed or other users.
•	No recommendation engine or taste profiling.
•	No external restaurant search APIs.
•	No complex auth; treat it as a personal tool/prototype for now.
The main success criteria:
•	The capture → parse → correct → link → rate flow is fast and intuitive.
•	The “My Dishes” grid and stats make it satisfying for me to keep using the app to log visits.
